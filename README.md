# rock-paper-scissors
a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors

For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console.

pseudocode :
1. create a function "getComputerChoice"
2. create 3 strings with rock, papaer, and scissors as values.
3. create a function "playRound" that takes 2 parameters; player selection, and computer selection
4. use the if else condition to play a single round of the game
5. call the `playRound` function into a new function `game` and play five rounds of the game while saving results.
